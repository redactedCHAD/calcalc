Below is a comprehensive **checklist** broken down into **phases**, covering the entire process of designing, building, testing, and deploying the Next.js food tracking app with Supabase, a food journal/calendar, and barcode scanning via the NutritionIx API. Each phase includes actionable steps you can **check off** as completed.

   - [x] Define MVP scope (authentication, manual entries, scanning feature)  
   - [x] Decide on additional nice-to-have features (e.g., macro goals, daily reminders)

2. **Design Mockups**  
   - [x] Sketch initial wireframes (low fidelity)

   - [x] Review mockups with stakeholders/teammates

3. **Technical Architecture**  
   - [x] Select main frameworks/libraries (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, etc.)  
   - [x] Plan data models (e.g., user profiles, food entries)  
   - [x] Decide on state management approach (React state, Context API, Zustand, etc.)  
   - [x] Identify 3rd-party APIs/services (NutritionIx, barcode scanning library)
